## General info

#### Inspiration
The biggset motivation to make that page is to show my skills and complete my cv. That leads to start work as frontend-dev.
This is third time, when I made a shopp app. This one is first finished. 
Page is responsive and Ive tried my best here :) Of course i will try to make it better or- more probably- start new better project. 
My plans are connected with react-redux as a store and TypeScript to write safer code.

#### Launch - 
To run this project, install it locally using npm or ...
just go to github.com/siemacotam/mainshop and enjoy :)
